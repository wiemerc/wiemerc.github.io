    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Constantin Wiemer and I'm writing here about my programming projects and IT-related topics I find interesting. With the later kind of articles I try to break down a subject and present it in a clear, yet detailed way, so that a person without much prior knowledge can understand it. In my opinion, such articles are often missing on the internet. Much stuff seems to be written for people that are either already experts or don't want to be bothered with details.</p>
<p>Currently I'm interested in systems programming in Python, C and sometimes assembly and learning how certain kinds of exploits work in detail ("How do hackers break into systems?"). Apart from the projects I wrote about here, I also wrote stuff like a <a href="https://github.com/wiemerc/CWLink">linker</a> for the long-forgotten AmigaOS or a <a href="https://github.com/wiemerc/xtftpd">TFTP server</a> that uses ICMP as transport protocol.</p>
<p>I'm a system administrator and software developer by trade, with stints in database administration, the world of networks (at a mobile network operator) and sometimes even project management. Although it seems to me that nowadays specialists are more in demand, I've always been an all-rounder and I like it that way. I tried to show in a <a href="https://wiemerc.github.io/images/kenntnisse.svg">mindmap</a> all the technologies I have experience with. At the moment I'm a technical lead, system administrator and software developer in the application monitoring field at a large insurance company and work with all the new technologies like cloud, containers, infrastructure as code, continuous integration / continuous delivery and so on.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to comments and questions and can be reached at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#110;&#116;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#119;&#105;&#101;&#109;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#120;&#46;&#100;&#101;">&#99;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#110;&#116;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#119;&#105;&#101;&#109;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#120;&#46;&#100;&#101;</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/wiemerc0x32">@wiemerc0x32</a>.</p>
